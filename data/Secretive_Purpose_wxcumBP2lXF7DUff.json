      "value": "<p>Seekers rarely identify themselves as members of the sect and are understandably secretive about their ultimate purpose. You can read and write messages written in Seekersâ€™ code, a secret mix of signs and symbols that allows Seekers to hide messages in the borders of roadside signs and to incorporate information into what appears to be common graffiti. This code allows you not only to keep your correspondence with others of your order secret, but also to contact other sect members in your area. You can usually rely on these fellow Seekers to lend you their aid from time to time. Your GM determines the availability and extent of any assistance you seek. </p><p>Additionally, you can be a member of any adventuring company and do not need to fulfill any membership prerequisites.</p>",
